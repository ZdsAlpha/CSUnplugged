      "desc": "The binary number system plays a central role in how information of all kinds is stored on computers. Understanding binary can lift a lot of the mystery from computers, because at a fundamental level they’re really just machines for flipping binary digits on and off. There are several activities on binary numbers in this document, all simple enough that they can be used to teach the binary system to anyone who can count! Generally children learn the binary system very quickly using this approach, but we find that many adults are also excited when they finally understand what bits and bytes really are.",

      "desc": "Many computer users are familiar with compressed formats such as zip, gzip, or gif images. These are based on a method called Ziv-Lempel coding, which turns out to be an interesting exercise in finding patterns in text.\nChildren’s rhymes and stories are good examples for text compression, because they often involve repeated words and sequences.",

      "desc": "The world is noisy place, and errors can occur whenever information is stored or transmitted. Error detection techniques add extra parity bits to data to determine when errors have occurred.\nThis activity is a magic trick which most audiences find intriguing. In the trick the demonstrator is “magically” able to figure which one out of dozens of cards has been turned over, using the same methods that computers use to figure out if an error has occurred in data storage.",

Many clever algorithms have been devised for putting values into order efficiently.\nIn this activity students compare different algorithms to sort weights in order.",

But how does a computer know which pixels to darken to make a line?\nThis activity shows how difficult it is for a computer to do something as simple as drawing a straight line or a circle, and shows a clever way (Bresenham’s algorithm) to do it quickly.\nThis exercise was developed by Joshua Scott (University of Canterbury).",
